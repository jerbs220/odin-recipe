    <ul>
        <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 packet (2 1/4 tsp) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups warm water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>

        <li>In a small bowl, combine warm water and sugar. Sprinkle yeast over the water and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Stir the mixture until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough, shape it into a loaf, and place it in a greased loaf pan. Cover and let it rise for another 30-45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the bread for 25-30 minutes or until it sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Allow the bread to cool before slicing. Enjoy your homemade bread!</li>
